<h1>Rust Design Patterns</h1>

<blockquote>In Rust we Trust</blockquote>

<h2>About Rust</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, the programming language, is an
    exciting new language that aims to be safe, concurrent, and practical.
</p>

<p>
    It combines the familiar C style syntax that uses curly braces with the
    features you'd expect in a modern language.
</p>

<p>
    Rust hopes to "preserve large-system integrity, availability and
    concurrency" by the separation it creates between its abstractions and
    implementations.
</p>


<h2>Design Patterns</h2>

<p>
    Design patterns have made a resurgence in recent years with the publication
    of the 1994 seminal work called <a href="http://amzn.com/0201633612">Design
    Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> (also called
    the Gang of Four book). It provided a catalog of design patterns that could be
    used across software systems.
</p>

<p>
    This website takes all the design patterns in the Gang of Four book and
    turns them into working examples using the language Rust.
</p>


<h3>Classes of Design Patterns</h3>

<p>Three classes.</p>

<h4>Creational</h4>

<ul class="pretty">
{% for post in site.categories.creational %}
    <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h4>Structural</h4>

<ul class="pretty">
{% for post in site.categories.structural %}
    <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h4>Behavioral</h4>

<ul class="pretty">
{% for post in site.categories.behavioral %}
    <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>
    As was mentioned, <a href="http://amzn.com/0201633612">Design Patterns:
    Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> is the main source of
    information provided on this website.
</p>

<p>
    Yet the Gang of Four book isn't the most approachable for newcomers. A
    more gentle introduction is the <a href="http://amzn.com/0596007124">Head
    First Design Patterns</a> book. It provides very memorable examples with
    easier to understand explanations.
</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>
    Rust Design Patterns is completely available as open source. It is hosted in
    <a href="http://github.com/jdavis/rust-design-patterns">GitHub</a> and can
    be forked by anyone.
</p>

<p>
     If you have suggestions on how to make these design patterns better, fork
     it and make a <a
     href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull
     request</a> with your updates. If the updates are awesome
     (which they probably will be) then the pull requests will be merged into
     the main project.
</p>
<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    Rust Design Patterns is a project that <a
    href="http://joshldavis.com/about/">Josh Davis</a> started to learn more
    about design patterns. He wanted to learn how to become a better software
    engineer yet also learn a new programming language.
